School projects, each file contains a solution to an assignment. 
Usually a compilation script is included called "c.exs" that compiles the other files, otherwise manual compilation is required.
Compile and run the code by entering iex or iex.bat into a command prompt then "c file.exs" to compile the file before "File.function(args)".
